## Introduction

Smart Home is a trending field in these days specially in the technology industry. This industry is a collections of skills needed to build a robust system, its unusual w.r.t. other systems, here you need to make the home components connected together and to give you the right response which should benefit you in the evaluation and controlling process.
New technologies make controlling and observing your home easier. Smartphones is a main player in this corner, itâ€™s with you in often times and developing its applications became more popular. 
Mainly, to increase your system efficiency you need to make things connected and controllable with the suitable and easiest way to make the user feeling comfortable with your system.
Wireless technologies preferred in this usage, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and microwave usable in this field. Here in our system, it depends on a Bluetooth connection between the microcontroller (Arduino) and android smartphone.
